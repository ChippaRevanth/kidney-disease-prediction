# kidney-disease-prediction
This project aims to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques by analyzing medical parameters. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training. The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring high-quality input for machine learning models. Various algorithms are tested and evaluated to determine the most accurate model for CKD prediction.

The project is implemented using Python with Jupyter Notebook as the development environment. Key libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn provide visual insights into the dataset. The machine learning models are developed using Scikit-learn, allowing efficient training and evaluation of classifiers. The repository follows a structured format, including separate directories for datasets, models, notebooks, and source code.
